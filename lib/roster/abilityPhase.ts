/**
 * Ability → phase classifier.
 *
 * Datasheet abilities carry no structured phase field — their `effect` and
 * `timing` strings are free 10th-edition prose. To decide which phase tab an
 * ability belongs on, we scan that prose for:
 *
 *  1. Literal phase words (`movement`, `shooting`, `charge`, `fight`,
 *     `command`, `battleshock` / `battle-shock`) — these catch phrases like
 *     "Shooting phase", "Fight phase", "Battle-shock test".
 *  2. A small set of verb aliases that 10e uses as proper nouns to refer to a
 *     phase implicitly (`Advances` → movement, `Shoots` → shooting, `Fights`
 *     → fight, `declares a Charge` → charge). These let abilities like
 *     "Each time this unit Advances, …" land on the movement tab even though
 *     the word "movement" never appears.
 *
 * Word-boundary matching keeps `\bcharge\b` from firing on "charged" or
 * "supercharger", and keeps `\bfight\b` from firing on "fights" (which has
 * its own pattern). Matching is case-insensitive throughout.
 *
 * An ability with **no** matches is treated as passive (e.g. "Invulnerable
 * Save", "Leader") and shown on **every** phase tab.

/**
 * Per-phase regex patterns, each tested against `effect + timing`.
 * Order within a phase doesn't matter — any match adds the phase.
 *
 * Round-boundary phrasing maps to the structural turn that owns the boundary:
 *  - "(at the) start of the (battle) round" → command phase (first phase of
 *    every battle round).
 *  - "(at the) end of the (battle) round" → battleshock (last step of every
 *    battle round). This catches durations like "until the end of the battle
 *    round" too; that's intentional — those abilities are still resolved during
 *    the battleshock step, so surfacing them there is correct.
